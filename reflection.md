- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

-Encapsulation is helpful for making sure that elements outside of the class canot affect elements inside that they should not be able to set/interact with. However, you have to be careful with encapsulation to make sure you are acessor/mutator methods when applicable to acess the values you need. It can take a little more time and be a little annoying and tricky at times but is overall helpful and a good programming tool. 

-Intially everything was smooth sailing until I got to the Train class. I had trouble intializng the right amount of cars in the train list. I went to TA hours and talked to the TA and then got help and figured out my syntax was just slightly off but I had the right idea. After, figuring that small issue out I also had to fix some small errors because I had forgotten to use the acessor methods to acess the cars in carlist when i was testing my train methods and in some of the train methods. After, this was fixed everything worked well. Advice I would give to people taking this course is make sure you pay attention to what you can acess where and how in different classes. Additonally, do not be afraid to go to TA hours and ask for help.
